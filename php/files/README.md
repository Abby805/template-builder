# PHP project template for Platform.sh

This project provides a starter kit for plain PHP projects hosted on [Platform.sh](http://platform.sh).

## Starting a new project

To start a new PHP project on Platform.sh, you have 2 options:

1. Create a new project through the Platform.sh user interface and select "start new project from a template".  Then select PHP as the template. That will create a new project using this repository as a starting point.

2. Take an existing project, add the necessary Platform.sh files, and push it to a Platform.sh Git repository.

## Using as a reference

You can use this repository as a reference for your own projects, and borrow whatever code is needed.  The most important parts are the [`.platform.app.yaml`](/.platform.app.yaml) file and the [`.platform`](/.platform) directory.

That's all you need to make a PHP application run on Platform.sh!
