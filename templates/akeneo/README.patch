-Akeneo PIM Community Standard Edition
+Akeneo PIM Community Standard Edition template for Platform.sh
 =====================================
 
-Welcome to Akeneo PIM Product.
+This project provides a starter kit for Akeneo projects hosted on [Platform.sh](http://platform.sh).  There are only very minor changes from vanilla Akeneo PIM Community Standard Edition.
 
-This repository is used to create a new PIM project based on Akeneo PIM.
+## Starting a new project
 
-If you want to contribute to the Akeneo PIM (and we will be pleased if you do!), you can fork the repository https://github.com/akeneo/pim-community-dev and submit a pull request.
+To start a new Akeneo project on Platform.sh, you have 2 options:
 
-Scrutinizer | Crowdin

-[![Scrutinizer Quality Score](https://scrutinizer-ci.com/g/akeneo/pim-community-dev/badges/quality-score.png?s=05ef3d5d2bbfae2f9a659060b21711d275f0c1ff)](https://scrutinizer-ci.com/g/akeneo/pim-community-dev/) | [![Crowdin](https://d322cqt584bo4o.cloudfront.net/akeneo/localized.svg)](https://crowdin.com/project/akeneo)
+1. Create a new project through the Platform.sh user interface and select "start new project from a template".  Then select Akeneo as the template. That will create a new project using this repository as a starting point.
 
-Application Technical Information
----------------------------------
+2. Take an existing project, add the necessary Platform.sh files, and push it to a Platform.sh Git repository.
 
-The following documentation is designed for both clients and partners and provides all technical information required to define required server(s) to run Akeneo PIM application and check that end users workstation is compatible with Akeneo PIM application:
-https://docs.akeneo.com/master/install_pim/manual/system_requirements/system_requirements.html
+## Using as a reference
 
-Installation instructions
--------------------------
+You can use this repository as a reference for your own Akeneo projects, and borrow whatever code is needed.  The most important parts are the [`.platform.app.yaml`](/.platform.app.yaml) file and the [`.platform`](/.platform) directory.
 
-### Recommended installation
 
-To install Akeneo PIM for a PIM project or for evaluation, please follow: https://docs.akeneo.com/master/install_pim/manual/installation_ce_archive.html
+Also see:
+ 
+* [`config.yml`](/app/config/config.yml) - At the top of this file in the `imports` section, a new resource is added named `parameters_platform.php`.  That will load a PHP file rather than YAML file to specify Symfony configuration parameters.
+* [`parameters_platform.php`](/app/config/parameters_platform.php) - This file contains Platform.sh-specific code to map environment variables into Symfony parameters. This file will be parsed on every page load. By default it only maps a default database and elasticsearch connection parameters. You can add to it as needed.
+* [`parameters.yml.dist`](/app/config/parameters.yml.dist) - This file is modified so the install process can retrieve the database connection parameters, SwiftMailer can connect to the correct host and the inital data set is set to `minimal`
 
-### Using Composer to create the project
+The template is configured to install the data set automatically during the build hook. That means after the first build and deployment, you can login with user: `admin` / password: `admin`.
 
-Alternatively, you can install Akeneo PIM with Composer, but please make sure that all requirements are fulfilled.
+Please note, that we use a worker for the Akeneo `job-queue-consumer-daemon`. That means you need to run this on a Medium plan or higher.
 
-If you don't have Composer yet, download it following the instructions on http://getcomposer.org/ or just run the following command:
-
-```
-    $ curl -s https://getcomposer.org/installer | php
-```
-
-Please note that you will certainly need to provide your GitHub credentials with this method.
-A lot of our dependencies are coming from GitHub and this reaches the max limit of 50 API calls from anonymous users.
-
-```
-    $ php composer.phar create-project --prefer-dist akeneo/pim-community-standard ./pim-project "3.1.*@stable"
-```
-
-After that, follow the instructions here:
-
-Manual: https://docs.akeneo.com/master/install_pim/manual/index.html
-Docker: https://docs.akeneo.com/master/install_pim/docker/installation_docker.html
-
-Upgrade instructions
---------------------
-
-To upgrade Akeneo PIM to a newer version, please follow:
-https://docs.akeneo.com/master/migrate_pim/index.html
+That's all you need to make a Akeneo application run on Platform.sh!
